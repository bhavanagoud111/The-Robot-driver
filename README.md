Cali Automation – Project Documentation
Overview
Cali Automation is an AI-driven web automation platform that turns plain-language goals into automated web actions. You describe what you want — such as finding products, researching news, or searching for jobs — and the system selects the most appropriate website, performs real browser automation, and returns structured, clickable results.
Core Features
Goal Understanding
Accepts natural-language goals across multiple categories: shopping, news, travel, jobs, education, and more.


No scripting or configuration required — the AI interprets your intent automatically.


Intelligent Decision-Making
Selects the right website for each task.


Generates a logical plan for interacting with that website.


Understands page structures and adapts to layout changes.


Executes each step while handling errors gracefully.


Browser-Level Automation
Uses real browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) to perform visible, traceable actions.


Includes stealth and anti-detection measures.


Captures real-world results from live web pages.




Accurate and Usable Results
Extracts real data: links, titles, prices, ratings, and descriptions.


Delivers results in a structured, clickable format.


Uses fallback extraction methods when primary selectors fail.
System Architecture
1. AI Brain with MCP Integration (ai_brain_mcp_integration.py)
Handles intent analysis, planning, and step-by-step automation logic.
2. Web API Server (web_api.py)
Implements a FastAPI-based REST API for task submission and monitoring:
POST /automate/goal – submit a new goal


GET /tasks/{task_id} – fetch task results


GET /tasks – list all active or completed tasks


GET /health – system health check


3. Web Interface (goal_interface.html)
Provides an easy-to-use frontend for entering goals, tracking progress, and viewing results.
4. Universal Automation Engine (universal_automation.py)
Executes the browser automation plan, manages fallback selectors, and applies stealth techniques.



Getting Started
Requirements
Python 3.8+


pip


Internet connection


Installation
./setup.sh
python3 start_web_interface.py

Then open http://localhost:8081.
First Run
Open the local web interface.


Enter a goal like “Find the best laptops under $1000.”


Start automation and watch the browser perform each step.


Review the extracted links and summaries.


Example Usage
API
Submit a goal:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/automate/goal \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_goal": "find cheapest halloween dress"}'


Check task results:
curl http://localhost:8000/tasks/{task_id}

AI Processing Pipeline
Goal Analysis – Understands the user’s intent.


Website Selection – Chooses the most suitable site (e.g., DuckDuckGo, Amazon, LinkedIn).


Plan Generation – Builds a browser interaction sequence (type, click, wait).


Execution – Performs automation using Playwright.


Result Extraction – Captures and structures final output.


Example:
goal_analysis = analyze_intent(user_goal)
selected_site = choose_site(goal_analysis)
automation_plan = generate_plan(selected_site)
execute_plan(automation_plan)
results = extract_results()

Technical Implementation Highlights
Browser Automation
Supports multiple browsers via Playwright.


Includes anti-detection options and stealth scripts to appear as human browsing.





Extraction Strategies
Adapts to different sites (DuckDuckGo, Google, Amazon).


Collects relevant metadata like product names, prices, and URLs.


Error Handling
Uses layered selector matching and fallback strategies.


Recovers from timeouts or missing elements.


API Reference Summary
POST /automate/goal — Start a new automation.


GET /tasks/{task_id} — Retrieve a specific task’s results.


GET /tasks — List all tasks.


GET /health — Check if the API is online.


Responses include task status, progress, and extracted data.
Setup and Configuration
Environment File
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
